The internet has many things that can help us to use devices from others countries in our
own device. One of the most famous protocols is RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).

Telnet is the first RDP, but is insecure and basic in these times, by default the port is
23, SSH on port 22. SSH (Secure Shell Protocol), adds the required layers of authentication
and encryption tothe communication model, making it a much more viable approach to perform
remote access and remotefile transfers. It is used both for patch delivery, file transfers,
log transfer, and remote management intoday's environment.

Basically, SSH is the secure way to use telnet and transfer files between hosts.

The CLI remote access was the first way to get a remote access between hosts, but the GUI
way is newer so this is a way that you can use to use the mouse, the keyboard, the screen,
etc.

xfreefdp /v:{target_ip} /cert:ignore /u:Administrator

/cert:ignore : Specifies to the scrips that all security certificate usage should beignored.
/u:Administrator : Specifies the login username to be "Administrator".
/v:{target_IP} : Specifies the target IP of the host we would like to connect to.
