On the network exist many ways to comunicate or transfer a message between tow end to end
points, the name of this protocol is SMB (Server Message Block), this protocol provides
shared access to files, printers and serial ports between endpoints on a network.

As the FTP protocol, the SMB has credentials and need users and passwords to access at the
files and printers of the other host, to create, edit, retrive and remover the SMB protocol
has ways to authenticate the client, in this case it required to provide a username/password
combination to interact with the things.

"Despite having the ability to secure access to the share, a network administrator can
sometimes makemistakes and accidentaly allow logins without any valid credentials or using
either guest accounts oranonymous log-ons." (0ne-nine9, 2021, Dancing.pdf)

To know the host of the SMB protocol use the next command:

smbclient -L {target_ip}

-L: Selecting the targeted host for the connection request.

Smbclient will attempt to connect to the remote host and check if there is any 
authentication required. Ifthere is, it will ask you for a password for your local username.
