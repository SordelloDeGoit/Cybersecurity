One of the most important things to do in a pentesting test is map or enumarete all of
the ports to find any vulnerability way to use to hack the system.

In this case I am going to use a "nmap" command (Network Mapper) and it will send request
over the target's ports, then it will recive a reply, determinating if the port is open or
not.

nmap -sV {target_ip}

-sV: service detection flag to determine the name and description of the indentified ser-
     vices.
