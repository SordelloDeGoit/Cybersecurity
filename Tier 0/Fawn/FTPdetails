An interesting thing about the FTP servers is the anonymous user, that has acces to
the FTP server.

Usually, the FTP server is allocated on port 21 and is not secure, to more security
it must use the SSH port to make an SFTP server.

To access a FTP server is neccesary know the IP, the user and the password and the
FTP server just process one instruction per second. After get into the server you can
explore the different commands in.

ftp {target_ip}

Finally to get the flag is necessary "get" the file using the next command.

get flag.txt
bye

And then the flag is ours.
