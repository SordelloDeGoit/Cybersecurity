Something important to know is about the web server, they work by a machine and works until
the maching is off, they can provide us a lot of imformation clicking on the web pages and
we could find a web page that is not public so it could be less secure and has many vulnera-
bilities.

The default port of a web server is the port 80/tcp (http). The address of a web page is
basically and IP address tranformated with a DNS server, so you can type www.name.com, but
behind it is an IP address.

gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u {target_IP}

dir : specify we are using the directory busting mode of the tool.
-w : specify a wordlist, a collection of common directory names that are typically usedfor
sites.
-u : specify the target's IP address.

gobuster is a tool to seek the hidden content into a link is written in Go. The tool was
make severalconnection attempts to the target using the HTTP GET method (requesting web
pages from the webserver)with different URL variations, such as:

GET http://{target_IP}/kittens
GET http://{target_IP}/hackers
GET http://{target_IP}/admin.php
GET http://{target_IP}/hackthebox
GET http://{target_IP}/yourespecial

Also, gobuster use a brute-lock way to find the other web services.
